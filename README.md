# dock-dodge

Unity-like window dodging for the macOS dock.

## Installation

Right now it's a bit rough. Open "Script Editor", open Preferences (Command+,), enable "Show Script menu in menu bar", open the User Scripts folder, and copy dock-dodge.applescript into there. You'll be able to launch it from the Script menu, but it'll show a spinning cog in the menu bar as long as it's running. It's distracting but you can hide it with Vanilla/Bartender. 

## To-do list
* Menu bar UI to interact with and configure settings
* Proper application wrapper instead of an AppleScript
